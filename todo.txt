- Add a list at the bottom with all the commit hashes, their dates and how many servers are pointing to each one (and maybe a check to ensure all are in the same commit)
- Add a check to ensure all the Current Times and all the Immutable Times are similar.
- Identify somehow the nodes that are outside the DAO.

- Add a timer telling when was the last refresh and how much left for the next one (and maybe a refresh now button).
