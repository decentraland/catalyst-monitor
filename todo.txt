- Add a list at the bottom with all the commit hashes and their dates
- Add a timer telling when was the last refresh and how much left for the next one (and maybe a refresh now button).

- Add a check to ensure all the Current Times and all the Immutable Times are similar.
- Identify somehow the nodes that are outside the DAO.
