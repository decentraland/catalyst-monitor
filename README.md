## How to start

In order to start with the template, clone the project in your local an execute `npm run init` in your PC. You'll need to write the project name, then it will remove the `.git` folder and init with a new git with an initial commit.

After that add the remote repository with `git remote add {repository}`.
Then execute `npm run prepare` to setup the husky script. (optional)

Running the `npm run init` command, this is a template will automatically config rollouts and build release, but you should review github workflow.
